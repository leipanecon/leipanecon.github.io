     As a developing economy, China's unprecedented patenting surge is puzzling. We study China's patent surge and its driving forces using a novel and comprehensive merged dataset on patent applications filed by Chinese firms. We find that R&D investment, FDI, and patent subsidy have different effects on different types of patents. First, R&D investment has a positive and significant impact on patenting activities for all types of patents under different model specifications. Second, the stimulating effect of foreign direct investment on patent applications is only robust for utility model patents and design patents. Third, the patent subsidy only has a positive impact on design patents. The results imply that FDI and patent subsidy may disproportionately spur low-quality patents.

      This paper investigates the relationship between imports and innovation by importing
      firms. We first construct a theoretical model in which imports stimulate innovation
      through cost-reducing knowledge spillovers. We then employ a combined micro dataset
      of Chinese manufacturing firms to estimate the effects of imported intermediates on the
      firm’s R&D investment. The dataset allows us to construct firm-year level instruments for
      importing and exporting that are uncorrelated with the innovation decision of the firm.
      Our estimations find that: (1) importing intermediates tends to increase importing firms’
      R&D intensity; and that (2) exporting also increases importing firms’ R&D intensity. Examining
      the channels through which importing affects innovation, we find that importing
      from high-income sources has a greater impact on innovation. High-tech firms tend to
      experience greater increases in innovation intensity, as do private firms. Our results are
      supported by a series of robustness checks.  </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
      This paper asks whether banks help or grab the enterprise in the real economy. Using the firm-
      level data on Chinese enterprises during 2001–2007, we find that interest payment of private
      enterprises is negatively related to the return on sales (ROS) and asset growth, which implies a
      detrimental effect of bank loans on private firms' performance. But this linkage is significantly
      positive for state-owned enterprises. Focusing on private enterprises, the grabbing impact from
      banks is strongest for firms without government subsidies, with low production values, with
      small size, or with low capital intensity. Our results are robust to alternative estimation
      approach and variable specifications. To conclude, the bank-centred financial system in China
      has assisted in the development of state-owned enterprises, while the development of private
      enterprises has been impeded by Chinese banks.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
      Building on a standard dynamic model of endogenous productivity change, I develop a flexible empirical framework to analyze the components of the returns to R&D and quantify the patent
      value. Applying it to a sample of Chinese high-tech manufacturing firms, I quantify the short-run
      and long-run benefits of R&D investment. I find that around 70% of the benefits of R&D investment
      comes from non-patenting innovation. On average an invention (a utility model) patent causes 0.76
      (0.67) percent increase in the firm value. The start-up costs of R&D is estimated to be around ten
      times as large as the maintenance costs. The counterfactual analysis shows that financing start-up
      innovation is more effective than financing the maintenance costs in stimulating the R&D investment.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper investigates the wage returns to schooling and actual early work experiences, and how these returns have changed over the past twenty years. Using the NLSY surveys, we develop and estimate a dynamic model of the joint schooling and work decisions that young men make in early adulthood, and quantify how they affect wages using a generalized Mincerian specification. Our results highlight the need to account for dynamic selection and changes in composition when analyzing changes in wage returns. In particular, we find that ignoring the selectivity of accumulated work experiences results in overstatements of the returns to education. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Residential mobility rates in the U.S. have fallen considerably over the past three decades. The cause of the long-term decline remains largely unexplained. In this paper we investigate the relative importance of alternative drivers of residential mobility, including job opportunities, neighborhood and housing amenities, social networks and housing and moving costs, using data from two waves of the NY Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Our hypothetical choice methodology elicits choice probabilities from which we recover the distribution of preferences for location and mobility attributes without concerns about omitted variables and selection biases that hamper analyses based on observed mobility choices alone. We estimate substantial heterogeneity in the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for location and housing amenities across different demographic groups, with income considerations, proximity to friends and family, neighbors' shared norms and social values, and monetary and psychological costs of moving being key drivers of migration and residential location choices. The estimates point to potentially important amplifying roles played by family, friends, and shared norms and values in the decline of residential mobility rates. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Over the past 20 years, elite colleges in the US have seen dramatic increases in applications. We provide context for part of this trend using detailed data on Harvard University that was unsealed as part of the <i>SFFA v. Harvard</i> lawsuit. We show that Harvard encourages applications from many students who effectively have no chance of being admitted, and that this is particularly true for African Americans. African American applications soared beginning with the Class of 2009, with the increase driven by those with lower SAT scores. Yet there was little change in the share of admits who were African American. We show that this change in applicant behavior resulted in substantial convergence in the overall admissions rates across races yet no change in the large cross-race differences in admissions rates for high-SAT applicants. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean's interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Applications to elite US colleges have more than doubled over the past 20 years, with little change in the number of available seats. We examine how this increased competition has affected the admissions advantage that legacies and athletes (LA) receive. Using data on Harvard applications over 18 years, we show that non-legacy, non-athlete (NLNA) applications grew considerably and that LA applications remained  at. Yet, the share of LA admits remained stable, implying substantial increases in admissions advantages for legacies and athletes. We develop a simple theoretical model of university admissions to frame our empirical analysis. Viewed through the lens of the model, stability in the share of LA admits implies that elite colleges treat the number of LA admits and overall admit quality as complements. Our empirical analysis reveals that, if the admissions advantages for LA applicants had been constant throughout this period, there would have been a large increase in the number of minority admits. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the role of labor market frictions and moving costs in explaining the migration behavior of US workers by employment status. Using data on low-skilled workers from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), I estimate a dynamic model of individual labor supply and migration decisions. The model incorporates a reduced-form search model and allows for migration for non-market reasons. My estimates show that moving costs are substantial and that labor market frictions primarily inhibit migration of the employed. I use the model to study migration responses to local labor market shocks and to a moving subsidy. Workers' preferences for non-market amenities, coupled with substantial moving costs and employment frictions, grant market power to incumbent employers. Large moving costs also likely affect employers' recruiting behavior. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> I examine the extent to which the returns to college majors are influenced by selective migration and occupational choice across locations in the US. To quantify the role of selection, I develop and estimate an extended Roy model of migration, occupational choice, and earnings where, upon completing their education, individuals choose a location in which to live and an occupation in which to work. In order to estimate this high-dimensional choice model, I make use of machine learning methods that allow for model selection and estimation simultaneously in a non-parametric setting. I find that OLS estimates of the returns to business and STEM majors relative to education majors are upward biased by 15% on average and by as much as 30%. Using estimates of the model, I characterize the migration behavior of different college majors and find that migration flows are twice as sensitive to occupational concentration as they are to wage returns. This finding has important implications for local governments seeking to attract or retain skilled workers. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the impact of a heretofore relatively unexplored input in the educational process&mdash;language environment at home&mdash;on student academic achievement during early childhood. Using the confidential data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (1998-99), we are able to exploit cross-sectional geographic variation in local language environment, augmented with the recently developed instrumental variable strategy in Lewbel (2012), to identify the causal effect. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that in the third grade, speaking a language other than English at home has a statistically significant, negative effect on reading test scores, but the effect does not exist for math test scores. Second, the pattern persists through the fifth grade. However, the negative effect on reading test scores appears to be a result of the initial gap in the third grade because we do not find the language environment at home has any effects on the growth rates in the test scores, regardless of subjects. Third, the pattern in the effects of language environment remains unchanged whether the foreign language is Spanish or not. Finally, we find that the pattern differs across gender. The language environment appears to have a negative effect on both reading and math scores among girls, while it has an effect only on reading scores among boys.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</div></p>
