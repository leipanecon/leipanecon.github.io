    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
      The impacts of energy poverty on a range of development goals have been widely examined in the literature; 
      however, how energy poverty affects public health has yet to be studied. Using annual data for a broad panel of 175 countries over the period 2000 to 2018, this paper investigates the effect of energy poverty on public health. 
      To identify the causal effect of energy poverty on public health and tackle the issue of endogeneity, 
      we rely on Oster's (2019) bound analysis and the system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. 
      Our results show that energy poverty has a detrimental effect on public health. We also find that living standards can serve as a channel through which energy poverty influences health, and that countries with higher standards of living weaken the negative effect of energy poverty on public health. 
      Our results are robust across various specifications and measures of health indicators. 
      Our findings have important implications for policies in public health and transitions to renewable energy.

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
      Many studies address the convergence in per capita CO2 emissions. However, whether countries with lower initial per capita emission levels can “catch up” with more emission-intensive countries is unknown. 
      Utilising historical CO2 emission data from 1907, this study investigates whether the per capita CO2 emissions of seven developing Asian economies; namely, China, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand, catch up with or converge toward that of the US in the long run. 
      We simultaneously examine the existence of per capita CO2 emissions convergence and the statistical contribution of the emissions drivers using the most recently developed covariate augmented Dickey-Fuller test, which allows for endogenous structural breaks. 
      The main results show firm evidence of catching-up or relative/absolute convergence between the Asian economies and the US in terms of per capita CO2 emissions. 
      Emissions drivers such as population and real GDP per capita growth may encourage the Asian economies to achieve and to maintain the long-run convergence toward the reference country.

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">
    Theoretically, it is well argued that environmental factors affect the growth of the tourism industry; however, from an empirical perspective, some gaps still exist in the literature. 
    We empirically examine the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions on tourist arrivals in a panel of G20 countries. 
    Using annual data from 1995 to 2014 and a series of panel data models, our results suggest that the growth of both CO2 and PM2.5 emissions adversely affects international tourist arrivals. 
    The results also show that the observed effect of CO2 emissions is more pronounced in developed economies, while the effect of PM2.5 emissions is stronger for developing economies. 
    Given these findings, our study provides and discusses a number of policy and practical implications.

    Cross-country capital flows have been widely studied in the literature; however, why some countries may form more similar foreign investment portfolios than others has not been investigated. 
    Using data for a broad panel of countries during the period 2002–2015, we adopt gravity equations to estimate cross-country foreign portfolio investment patterns. 
    The main empirical results reveal that countries are more likely to form similar foreign portfolio investment patterns if:(i) countries are geographically closer; (ii) countries share the same official language; and (iii) countries adopt fixed exchange rate regimes.

    We examine the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on financial inclusion. 
    To identify the causal effect of FDI on financial inclusion, we use plausibly exogenous source of variations in bilateral investment treaties (BITs) as a novel instrumental variable (IV) for net FDI inflows. 
    Using annual data for a broad panel of 90 countries over the period 2004 to 2017, our results show that FDI improves financial inclusion both for "access to finance" and "use of financial services". 
    This impact is more pronounced for relatively poor countries and developing countries compared to rich and developed countries. 
    We also find that higher financial market development and quality institutions improve financial inclusion directly. 
    Moreover, financial market development and institutional quality can serve as potential channels and moderating variables through which FDI affects financial inclusion. 
    Our results are robust to various estimations and sample splitting, and have important implications for policy on financial inclusion.

    The interplay between the stock market and the real economy is crucial in the various channels through which financial markets drive economic growth. 
    In the current study, we investigate the effects of this relationship on the Chinese economy, which is the fastest growing and largest emerging economy in the world. 
    The methodology incudes unit root testing in the presence of structural breaks and the Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. 
    The results of the analysis showed that the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2012 had a significant impact on both the real sector and the financial sector in China. 
    Our findings also suggest that the Shanghai A share market has had a long-run negative association with the real sector of the economy; however, the magnitude of impact has been miniscule. 
    These findings indicate that this negative relationship is proof of the so-called existence of irrational prosperity in the stock market and the economic bubble in China's financial sector. 
    The findings did not show any evidence of a relationship between the stock market and the real economy in the short run. 
    Toda Yamamoto causality test showed that economic growth has spurred the development of the Shenzhen B share market. 
    Furthermore, the equally weighted index showed that stock market liquidity and stock market sectoral indices were alternative measures of stock market activities. 
    The results were robust to the alternative measures of stock market activities. 
    The results also indicate that state-owned monopolies play an important role in China's economic performance because they stimulate the economy in the short run.

    This paper examines the factors that predict an IMF bailout. 
    In doing so, we use a large dataset from 1993 to 2021 with 6550 observation and 138 features and adopt recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence models such as tree-based, boosting and artificial neural network techniques. 
    We find that apart from traditional indicators such as debt and macroeconomic factors, agricultural, energy, health and social factors are strong predictors of an IMF bailout. 
    These factors have hitherto not received much attention in the literature.

    We examine hot-debated but underexplored questions of whether and how green strategies affect corporate green revenues. 
    Using a generalized Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework, we find that green strategies significantly enhance corporate green revenues in the presence of China’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) pilot. 
    This is consistent with the Porter Hypothesis. 
    Our mechanism analyses document that green strategies increase green revenues by improving green quality and catalyzing environmentally friendly transformation. 
    This study has important implications for policymakers and practitioners, offering new insights into the intended consequences and real outcomes of environmental regulations.

    Employing fixed and random effects estimation techniques on five-year-non-overlapping-averaged data, covering 1980 through 2019, this study, firstly, investigates, empirically, the potential bi-causal relationship between international tourist arrivals and the importation of consumables/merchandises, in the case of 45 sovereign islands. 
    The economic growth implication of a concurrent pursuit of tourism expansion and merchandise imports is also examined. 
    The study further investigates how over-reliance on imported merchandise to feed international tourists, and over-specialisation in the tourism sector, affect the tourism-led-growth hypothesis in the case of these islands. 
    Results from the study show that an increase in arrivals of international tourists significantly leads to an increase in the importation of consumable merchandises, and vice versa. 
    In addition, an importation of merchandises to sustain international tourist arrivals is significantly observed not to be detrimental to the economic growth of these islands. 
    However, the results further reveal that over-reliance on imported merchandises for the sake of international tourists, as well as over-specialisation in tourism with the help of imported merchandises, both exert significant detrimental net effects on the economic growth of islands across the globe. 
    The findings hold policy guidelines for the pursuit of tourism-led and merchandise-import-led growth strategies among global islands.

    In doing so, we use average slope of terrain as an instrument for electrification rate. 
    Using panel data for 44 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the period 2000 to 2018, the results suggest that more people having access to electricity can promote financial development. 
    In addition, mobile phone and commercial bank branches diffusion serve as potential channels through which access to electricity affects financial development. 
    Our results are robust to sample-splitting and different estimation techniques. 
    The results have important implications for policies in overcoming barriers to electricity access.

    Focusing on several specific quantiles, eleven countries have significant convergence tendencies. 
    Moreover, there are four definite patterns related to shocks on the relative house prices across quantiles.

    This paper examines the causes of falling labour share in OECD and non-OECD countries since the 1980s by using Karabarbounis and Neiman’s (2014) labour share model. 
    While both groups of countries experience an elasticity of substitution between capital and labour, the factors driving down labour share are different. 
    In OECD countries, export and volatility are key drivers, but in non-OECD countries, the significant factors are financial openness and the capital’s relative price. 
    Overall, technological advancement – as reflected by declining capital’s relative price - coupled with globalisation and low economic risk are key factors in explaining a long-term decline of labour share world- wide.

    This paper investigates the portfolio diversification possibilities between BRICS and the US stock market. 
    Using bootstrap full-sample Granger causality and bootstrap rolling-window sub-sample Granger causality tests, we did not find evidence supporting the causal linkage between BRICS and the US stock markets; time-varying causality was observed for particular sub-samples. 
    Our findings imply that BRICS stock markets can provide diversification possibilities for US investors most of the time; however, such opportunities become extremely limited during crisis periods. 
    We also find that stock markets are more likely to be causally linked if they have similar business conditions, excess returns and size premiums.

    The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted significant damage to the world economy, and the tourism and leisure industry is no exception. 
    This paper investigates the effect of COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine rollouts and government policy responses on Australia's tourism and leisure industry. 
    To do so, we use data on stock market performances of the travel and leisure industry as key indicators. 
    Our findings show that while vaccine rollouts help for a partial recovery of the travel and leisure industry, full and speedy recovery remains a challenge under stringent policies related to COVID-19 safety suggesting the enormous magnitude of the task ahead in terms of policy responses.

        <b>Abstract:</b> This paper investigates the role of R&D investment in shaping the relationship be-
          tween financial constraints and aggregate total factor productivity (TFP). I study a dynamic model in which R&D investment, which affects productivity evolution endogenously, is subject to financial constraints. I parameterize the model with production, in   novation, and balance sheet data. The estimated model implies sizeable static TFP losses
          caused by capital misallocation and dynamic TFP losses from distorting R&D investment.
          The accumulation of internal funds reduces the static TFP loss gradually. In contrast,
          because R&D has a persistent effect on productivity, the dynamic TFP loss rises initially
          and declines later. Compared to a model with exogenous productivity, innovation in-
          vestment makes firms less able to use self-financing to reduce TFP losses, and prolongs
          the transition. Improving the pledgeability of intangible assets in China to be the US
          level reduces the static TFP loss only 0.4%, but the dynamic TFP loss by 7.1%.

      This paper provides a semi-structural approach for analyzing the treatment effects on productivity. We embed the potential outcome framework into a dynamic model with firm-level productivity that can be affected by some discrete treatment. The treatment can either be externally assigned or chosen by the firm. We characterize conditions for non-parametrically identifying production functions. Then we
      provide conditions for identifying ATTs for absorbing treatment and generalize them to non-absorbing treatment. Our study has general implications for empirical studies on evaluating treatment effects on productivity.

      <b>Abstract:</b>  This paper studies the identification property and estimation of a multiproduct firm model with firm-product production functions and firm-product level productivity. We characterize a set of moment conditions using the multiproduct firm’s first-order conditions and the productivity’s evolution process. We first show that the production functions are nonparametrically non-identified without observing the input allocations. For parametric production functions, we formally prove that the Cobb-Douglas production functions are point identified under mild conditions and the standard GMM method can be applied. For more general parametric production functions, we propose using the partial identification method. We provide Monte Carlo evidence suggesting that the CES production functions are partially identified. Applying our method to a sample of grain manufacturing firms, we find that the production functions for single-product and multiproduct firms are different for the same product.

    <b>Abstract:</b> This paper proposes that processing trade not only leads goods to be “Made in China,” but
also “Created in China.” Using unique transaction-level trade data, we find that a significant
share of exporters engages in both ordinary and processing export activities, and they exhibit
superior performance. There is a close link between firms' export mode choice and brand ownership, and there is a price premium associated with own-branded products. Lastly, firms intensify their branding activities when facing favorable processing policies upstream. To rationalize these findings, we present a simple framework where multi-attributes firms endogenously specialize
within the production network.
