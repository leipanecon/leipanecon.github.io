     As a developing economy, China's unprecedented patenting surge is puzzling. We study China's patent surge and its driving forces using a novel and comprehensive merged dataset on patent applications filed by Chinese firms. We find that R&D investment, FDI, and patent subsidy have different effects on different types of patents. First, R&D investment has a positive and significant impact on patenting activities for all types of patents under different model specifications. Second, the stimulating effect of foreign direct investment on patent applications is only robust for utility model patents and design patents. Third, the patent subsidy only has a positive impact on design patents. The results imply that FDI and patent subsidy may disproportionately spur low-quality patents.

      This paper investigates the relationship between imports and innovation by importing
      firms. We first construct a theoretical model in which imports stimulate innovation
      through cost-reducing knowledge spillovers. We then employ a combined micro dataset
      of Chinese manufacturing firms to estimate the effects of imported intermediates on the
      firm’s R&D investment. The dataset allows us to construct firm-year level instruments for
      importing and exporting that are uncorrelated with the innovation decision of the firm.
      Our estimations find that: (1) importing intermediates tends to increase importing firms’
      R&D intensity; and that (2) exporting also increases importing firms’ R&D intensity. Examining
      the channels through which importing affects innovation, we find that importing
      from high-income sources has a greater impact on innovation. High-tech firms tend to
      experience greater increases in innovation intensity, as do private firms. Our results are
      supported by a series of robustness checks.  </div></p>

      This paper asks whether banks help or grab the enterprise in the real economy. Using the firm-
      level data on Chinese enterprises during 2001–2007, we find that interest payment of private
      enterprises is negatively related to the return on sales (ROS) and asset growth, which implies a
      detrimental effect of bank loans on private firms' performance. But this linkage is significantly
      positive for state-owned enterprises. Focusing on private enterprises, the grabbing impact from
      banks is strongest for firms without government subsidies, with low production values, with
      small size, or with low capital intensity. Our results are robust to alternative estimation
      approach and variable specifications. To conclude, the bank-centred financial system in China
      has assisted in the development of state-owned enterprises, while the development of private
      enterprises has been impeded by Chinese banks.

      Building on a standard dynamic model of endogenous productivity change, I develop a flexible empirical framework to analyze the components of the returns to R&D and quantify the patent
      value. Applying it to a sample of Chinese high-tech manufacturing firms, I quantify the short-run
      and long-run benefits of R&D investment. I find that around 70% of the benefits of R&D investment
      comes from non-patenting innovation. On average an invention (a utility model) patent causes 0.76
      (0.67) percent increase in the firm value. The start-up costs of R&D is estimated to be around ten
      times as large as the maintenance costs. The counterfactual analysis shows that financing start-up
      innovation is more effective than financing the maintenance costs in stimulating the R&D investment.

      This paper investigates the negative consequences of
         anti-corruption measures on economic outcomes. By exploiting an unexpected
         corruption crackdown in Northeast China in 2004, we ﬁnd that the crackdown signiﬁcantly
          lowers ﬁrm productivity and reduces ﬁrm entry. The negative impacts are mainly
          borne by private and foreign ﬁrms while the state-owned ﬁrms are intact.
          We further ﬁnd that private ﬁrms with personal connections fare
          worse than the state-owned ﬁrms, while unconnected private ﬁrms do
          not behave diﬀerently after the crackdown. Our findings suggest that cracking down
          on corruption may weaken some connected private firms' political ties and remove
          the "grease of the wheels" that supports firm development in weak market
          institutions.

      In this paper, we show that there exists a special breed of firms that are active in both
    ordinary and processing exports. Contrary to the existing literature that describes processing
    firms as inferior, these mixed firms are superior to other firms in multiple dimensions, and hence
    we call them “super processors.” We build on Antras et al. (2017) and Bernard et al. (2019)
    to develop a model in which firms are heterogeneous in multiple stages of production. Firms
    endogenously choose to become suppliers or final good producers, with those that excel in both
    manufacturing ability and blueprint quality engage in both activities. We test the theory by
    exploiting the adoption of the pilot “paperless” processing trade supervision programme by
    regional customs authorities in China that lowered the cost of processing trade but left ordinary
    trade costs unchanged. We find that facilitating processing exports induces productive domestic
    downstream firms to establish their own trademarks. Our results highlight that processing trade
    not only leads goods to be “Made in China,” but also “Created in China.”

      We study a stylized model of multi-product firms with firm-product level
      heterogeneity in Hicks-neutral production technology. The productivity process
      allows flexible correlation between the production efficiency of different products.
      We characterize the empirical content and show that the scale and location of the
      production function are non-parametrically non-identified without observing the
      allocation of inputs and exogenous input price variations. Based on the model’s
      empirical content, we develop an estimation strategy for any parametric family
      of production functions. For general production functions, we argue this proce-
      dure is subject to unclear identification and heavy computation. In the case of
      Cobb-Douglas production function, we show the optimal input allocation rules
      can be solved in closed form and the corresponding moment conditions identify
      the production functions. Monte Carlo evidence shows that our identification
      strategy performs well. We then apply our methodology to a sample of agricul-
      tural goods manufacturing firms and show that multi-product firms’ production
      technologies differ from single-product firms even for the same product. We also
      find that multi-product firms produce its core (peripheral) products at higher
(lower) technical efficiency than single-product firms. Lastly, we find a strong
positive comovement between the productivity shocks of different product lines.

      We study a model in which firms differ in their defaulting risks to study the
     relationship between bank competition and risky investment. Banks face asymmetric information when lending to firms and compete in a Betrand-
     Edgeworth game. In equilibrium firms with higher defaulting risks are credit rationed. We show that increasing banking competition enhances investment by firms with low
     defaulting risks at the extensive margin, and stimulates investment by firms with large defaulting risks. Employing a deregulation policy for city commercial banks in China,
     we find empirical evidence consistent with predictions of the model.
